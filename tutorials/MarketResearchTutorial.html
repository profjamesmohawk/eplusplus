<h1>COMP-10132 Market Research Tutorial</h1>

<p class="description">
Many say that formal market research is the only way to properly know your customers.  Let's conduct our own little experiment.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Experiment Description</h2>
<p class="description">
Today we will compare the effectiveness of interviews verses questionnaires. Each group will work to answer the question "What do students think about the new Mohawk athletics and recreation centre?"
</p>
<ol>
<h3>As a group:</h3>
<li>Create 4 questions that can answered yes/no.</li>
<li>Create 2 questions that can be answered with full sentences.</li>
<h3>Individually (on campus):</h3>
<li>Spend 15 minutes administering your yes/no questions.</li>
<li>Spend 15 minutes administering your short answer questions.</li>
<h3>As a group:</h3>
<li>Compare your answers.</li>
<li>Prepare to present your findings:</li>
<ol type="a">
	<li>Which method allowed you to survey the greatest number of participants?</li>
	<li>Which method would be best for producing pretty charts?</li>
	<li>Which method would be best administered by a co-op student?</li>
	<li>Which method would be best administered by Rob McIsaac?</li>
	<li>Did you find out anything surprising?</li>
	<li>How would you like to be surveyed?</li>
	<li>If Rob McIsaac called you at home, would you take time to talk to him?</li>
	<li>If a call centre agent called you at home, would you "answer some questions about Mohawk College"? </li>
</ol>
