<h1>COMP-10132 Costing Exercise</h1>
<p class="description">
Exercise may be done individually or in groups of up to three.
</p>

<h2>Scenario:</h2>
<p class="description">
Apple has announced that OS/X, the Macintosh operating system, will be sold without hardware for a price of $200.  One of BitCo's biggest customers, CHCH TV, has complained that the Macintosh Pro systems they use for video editing are too expensive.  
</p>
<p class="description">
Management has asked your team to investigate assembling custom systems for CHCH and other customers.  Use the current Macintosh Pro specifications and component pricing from the web to determine if this opportunity is worth pursuing.
</p>
<p class="description">
You may present your conclusions to the class or submit a report to the eLearn Drop Box.  For group submissions, have one student submit the report and a list of team members.
