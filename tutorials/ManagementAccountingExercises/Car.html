<h1>Which Car?</h1>
<p class="description">
You need to buy a company car to visit the customers of you small software company.  Your biggest customer is a Toyota dealer so you've decided on either a Camry or a Camry Hybrid.
</p>

<ol>
<li>The Camry can be had on a 4 year lease for $96/week.  </li>
<li>The Camry uses 8.1 l/km in the city and 5.7 l/km on the highway.  </li>
<li>The Hybrid can be had on a 4 year lease for $115/month. </li>
<li>The Hybrid uses 4.9 l/km in the city and 4.8 l/km on the highway. </li>
</ol>

<ol type="a">
<li>Which car should you purchase and why?  </li>
</ol>
<p class=description>
There are three variables that impact your decision: gas price, weekly km in the city, weekly km on the highway.  Problems like this are great for spreadsheets.  A Spreadsheet makes it easy to run many scenarios.
