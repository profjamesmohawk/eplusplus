<h1>Password Reset Application</h1>
<p class="description">
You work for Acme Cogs and are considering the development of a self-serve password reset application that will reduce calls to the help desk.
</p>

<p class="description">
Should you invest in this application?
</p>

<strong>The project will:</strong>
<ul>
<li>take 2 developers 6 months</li>
<li>require a $5,000 development server to be purchased before the project starts</li>
<li>require a $5,000 production server to be purchased before the app goes live</li>
<li>increase calls to the help desk by 100/month for the first two months of production</li>
<li>reduce calls to the help desk by 200/month for the next 34 months</li>
<li>servers cost $100/month to host</li>
<li>developers cost $80/hour</li>
<li>each help desk call costs $50</li>
</ul>

<p class=description>
Classical financial math can be used to answer questions like this one, but few people do such math anymore.  A much more common approach is to create a spreadsheet tracking all the costs and benefits, month by month.  
</p>
<p class=description>
Use any strategy you like to answer the question in your tutorial.
