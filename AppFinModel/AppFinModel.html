<h1>Financial Modelling</h1>
<p class="description">
We will build a trivial financial model.  Our goal is to explore tools and techniques.  An accurate model is beyond the scope of this course.
</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p class="description">
You have authored a hot new app.  It's called WordleGo and it combines the best of Wordle and Pokemon Go.  We will build a trivial financial model to see the effects of growth and pricing.
</p>

<h3>Assumptions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You currently have 10K users. </li>
<li>The model will cover 24 months at the month level.</li>
<li>Your user base will grow exponentially for 6 months then decline exponentially for 18 months. </li>
<li>You may choose to charge a onetime license fee, a monthly fee, or a combination of the two.  </li>
<li>Any revenue from advertising or data harvesting will be recorded as a monthly fee.  </li>
<li>When calculating revenue or cost based on number of users, we will always use the number of users at the start of the month.  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Assignment:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Complete the template <a href="./WordleGo.xlsx">worksheet.</a> </li>
<li>Use your completed spreadsheet to answer the quiz questions on Canvas.  </li>
</ol>
